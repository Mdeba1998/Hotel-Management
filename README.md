Developed a Hotel Management System utilizing Java, JSP, Servlet, JDBC, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Oracle 
Database. This project facilitates efficient management of hotel operations, enabling users to view available rooms with 
pricing details, make room reservations, and receive detailed invoice bills via email. Implemented features to calculate total 
invoice bills in real-time during the booking process, enhancing user experience and streamlining hotel management 
processes. 

NOTE: This project only for the use from user side. Once the user book the room he/she doesn't have the authority to cancel the booking. They need to visit the hotel to cancel.
